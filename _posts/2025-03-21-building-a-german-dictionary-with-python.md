In this post I'll talk about my latest project [German Article Game](https://namerror.github.io/German-Article/), more about *how* I did it (think of this as a development document). You can also check out the [Project page](https://leonlong.space/project/software/web/der-die-das-game) of this project, which is a more generic description of the project and the purpose of it. 

## The Basic Idea
We want to make a game that allows user to learn the gender of German words, which is associated with three articles "der", "die" and "das". I designed three buttons for them, they just need to press the right one.

So what do we need to do to make this? Let's just throw away all the annoying front-end knowledge for now.
# The Plan
First, get a list of words. Then, choose a word from the list and check if user pressed the right button. Repeat the process. That's basically the plan.

However, it occurred to me that the first step was the hardest.
