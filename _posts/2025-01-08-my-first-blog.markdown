## This is the first blog of this site
Hello, I just decided to set up this site as my personal website, and this is my first blog. Here I will show my recent work, share notes and publish projects. I hope to use this space to not only showcase my work to people that are interested, but also motivate myself to keep learning.

~~*if the website you are seeing looks ugly or messy, that means I'm still working on it (or I'm just too lazy).*~~
*Update on 18th January: After a few days of debugging, the blog system is finally working, and I included a nice category tool to help navigate between posts. This is why I hate web programming, the debugging is mentally draining and it's always for some minor feature. I guess I'll just leave the site like this for a while.*
