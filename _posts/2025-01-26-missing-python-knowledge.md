Python was the first language I learned when I started programming at twelve. I've worked on many projects with this language, and in a way I even learned this language twice: once by myself, and a second time in my college CS class. 

However, it occured to me that there are some parts of this language that are hardly taught in university lectures - at least in my CS classes, as a freshman - and there are some aspects of Python that I haven't completely explored yet. Python is a powerful language, but it's easy to ignore and forget some powerful techniques when you think of it as merely a script language that can be learned within the length of a YouTube video. 

> Life is short. Use Python.

I am starting a new column called *Python: the Missing Bits of University Lectures*, in which I will collect Python tricks and usage that I was unfamilair with, as a review for my Python knowledge as well as an extra resource for people that only learned the basics.

This includes:

 - [ ] String processing
 - [ ] Pattern matching and regex
 - [ ] Read/Write
 - [ ] Web scraping
 - [ ] Blablabla, we'll see
