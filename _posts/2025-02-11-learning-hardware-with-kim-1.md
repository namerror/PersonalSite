## Disclaimer
There is nothing technical in this post, only sharing some news.
# Background
It's always been a shame, a flaw, that my university decided to isolate the College of Computer Science, while putting Electrical and Computer Engineering in another college, so that CS kids are restricted from touching circuits and electronics, while engineers don't get to learn algorithms. Recently I snuck into a hardware class at my uni's ECE department, and I am even more annoyed by this problem. Anyways, we are currently learning hands-on hardware programming and circuit building with the 6502 microprocessor using the KIM-1 (Keyboard Input Monitor). 

Wait - let me write this in a serious way.
Materials used:
- KIM-1
- *Microcomputer Experimentation with the MOS Technology KIM-1* by Lance A. Leventhal (The Blue Book)
- [The Pink Sheet](https://www.atarimania.com/documents/6502%20%2865xx%29%20Microprocessor%20Instant%20Reference%20Card.pdf)
- *6502 Assembly Language Programming* by Lance A. Leventhal (The Orange Book)
- bread board
- Resistors
- Wires, lots of wires
- 5V power supply
- ...

# Progress Update
So far, I've read through and finished Lab 0 and Lab 1 in the Blue Book. Today I started with Lab 2. I've built the circuit for simple input with 8 switches representing 8 bits.

This is how it looks IRL:
