This is a website aimed at German learners that struggle with memorizing the articles (Der Die Das) of nouns. I offer a solution here: press the button to find out! I have devided words into different groups according to the learner's level (A1, A2, B1, B2, etc.), so even if you are a beginner, you can totally use this to enhance your vocab.

### For my Tech Friends
This website is a light project programmed with HTML, CSS and JS. The word list used for the website is collected by webscraping with Python (In fact, that was the most important and time-consuming part).
